# FPGA-ATM-Project
FPGA ATM Project made for CS 303 Logic Course in Sabanci University 

Simple Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

You will design a simple ATM and implement it on the FPGA device.

You will be asked to demonstrate your implementation on the BASYS FPGA board . In your design, there will be login operation where the user first should insert its debit card and then enter his/her password. After having entered the password correctly, 
user may do: 1) deposit/withdraw money to/from his/her account, 2) change the password of the account or 3) log out from the ATM.
